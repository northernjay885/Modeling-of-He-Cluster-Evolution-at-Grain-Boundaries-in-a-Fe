# Modeling of He Cluster Evolution at Grain Boundaries in a Fe
 
Physical modeling of the energy at grain boundaries can induce large computing overhead. By utilizing machine learning, these predictive model can be used to simulate the He-cluster evolution at the grain boundaries in a Fe atom with less computing cost. 

## Getting Started

Install jupternotebook and run the specific ipynb file.

### Prerequisites

Install [anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/).

### Installing

Set up a virtual environment by
```
conda create --name phy python=3.7
```
